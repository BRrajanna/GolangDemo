#array 
An array is a collection of elements that belong to the same type.

#forloop
for is the only loop available in Go. Go doesn't have while or do while loops which are present in other languages like C.

#maps
A map is a builtin type in Go that is used to store key-value pairs. Let's take the example of a startup with a few employees. For simplicity, let's assume that the first name of all these employees is unique. We are looking for a data structure to store the salary of each employee. A map will be a perfect fit for this use case. The name of the employee can be the key and the salary can be the value. Maps are similar to dictionaries in other languages such as Python.

#structure
A struct is a user-defined type that represents a collection of fields. It can be used in places where it makes sense to group the data into a single unit rather than having each of them as separate values. 

#goroutines
Goroutines are functions or methods that run concurrently with other functions or methods. Goroutines can be thought of as light weight threads. The cost of creating a Goroutine is tiny when compared to a thread. Hence it's common for Go applications to have thousands of Goroutines running concurrently.

#Defer
Defer statement is used to execute a function call just before the surrounding function where the defer statement is present returns.
